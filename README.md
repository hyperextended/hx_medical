# RP Medical - WIP

Simple medical system for [ox_core]() that leverages StateBags, statuses and the [CEventNetworkEntityDamage](https://github.com/logan-mcgee/FiveM-Documentation/blob/master/GameEvents/EventList.md#182---ceventnetworkentitydamage) game event.

Our goal was to decouple the EMS job from the medical system to allow more flexibility. This system will not include EMS but we do plan on writing that as a separate resource.

This script handles:

1. Wounding statuses using ox_core's status system.
   - bleed
   - stagger
   - unconscious
2. Player death and respawning using player state.
3. Usage of Pillbox (default configured to [AshiroDev's hospital map](https://forum.cfx.re/t/interior-map-pillbox-medical-center-top-floor/949788)) for self-serve care.

Many lines of code have been borrowed from [qbox-ambulancejob](https://github.com/Qbox-project/qb-ambulancejob) and their efforts have saved us a significant amount of work and time. Thanks guys.
